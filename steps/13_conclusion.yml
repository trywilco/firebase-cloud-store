              Congratulations on completing this codelab! 🎉

              You've learned how to:
              - Perform basic and advanced operations with Cloud Firestore
              - Work with real-time data updates
              - Secure your data with Firebase security rules

                Great work! You've successfully secured your app with Firebase rules.
                These rules ensure:
                - Only authenticated users can read and create restaurants
                - Restaurant names can't be changed after creation
                - Users can only create ratings under their own user ID
                
                Your app is now protected against unauthorized access! 🔒✨

              using npm: `npm -g install firebase-tools`. Verify installation
              with `firebase --version` to ensure you're on v7.4.0 or later.
              Use Firebase CLI to authorize and link your local project to Firebase:
              `firebase login`, then go to `vanilla-js` directory and run `firebase use --add`. Name your Firebase
              project as default during prompts and associate it correctly."
          - text: "Now let's run the app in your Codespace! Execute `firebase emulators:start --only hosting`
              in your terminal. The service will start on port 5000. Look for the 'Ports' tab
              in your Codespace and click on the forwarded URL for port 5000 to open your FriendlyEats app
              in a new tab. The app will automatically connect to Firebase and sign you in as an anonymous user."

              Let's secure your app with proper Firebase rules. Update your `firestore.rules` file:

              ```
              rules_version = '2';

              service cloud.firestore {
                function unchanged(key) {
                  return (key in resource.data) && (key in request.resource.data) && (resource.data[key] == request.resource.data[key]);
                }

                match /databases/{database}/documents {
                  match /restaurants/{restaurantId} {
                    allow read: if request.auth != null;
                    allow create: if request.auth != null;
                    allow update: if request.auth != null &&
                      (request.resource.data.keys() == resource.data.keys()) && unchanged('name');
                    
                    match /ratings/{ratingId} {
                      allow read: if request.auth != null;
                      allow create: if request.auth != null &&
                        request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
              ```

              Deploy these rules with: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
    - actionId: ready_message
      params:
        person: lucca

                Great work! You've successfully secured your app with Firebase rules.
                These rules ensure:
                - Only authenticated users can read and create restaurants
                - Restaurant names can't be changed after creation
                - Users can only create ratings under their own user ID
                
                Your app is now protected against unauthorized access! ğŸ”’âœ¨

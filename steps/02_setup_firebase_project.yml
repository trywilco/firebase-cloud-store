          - text: Time to rev up those engines and set up your Firebase project. In the
              Firebase console, click 'Add project' and name it FriendlyEats.
              Remember the Project ID assigned, like friendlyeats-1234, as it's
              your unique identifier. This will be used for CLI operations and
              more. This step is essential as it creates the backbone for our
              application. Once your project is set up, you can start to
              leverage Firebaseâ€™s power to host and serve structured data.
              Remember, the display name is FriendlyEats, but keep an eye on
              that unique Project ID.
